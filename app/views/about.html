 		</div>
 
		<div class="theContent" >
			<p>Fictionset.in tackles just one of the ways you might find new books to read, by organising find novels by where they are set. This means that you could read a pile of books that are set in <a href="#/place/2988507">Paris</a> if you wanted to. </p>
			<p>Why? For fun, interest, or if perhaps if you're planning a visit, it might help you understand something of the 'soul' of the place, like a guidebook and map will help you with the layout of it.</p>
			<h3>Between the lines</h3>
<p>As anyone who has satified curiosity by taking a peek at a guidebook's notes on their hometown knows, places are more than just a list of sights to see and historical points of interest. The essence of place is found in the people who inhabit it, and the stories that happen there - a fountain is just a fountain until you know it's where your grandparents first met. In novels, we meet the stories that bring a place to life. </p>

<p>Since forever we have learned more from stories than we have in classrooms. Stories have a way of dragging us in, making subjects and places come alive. In the same way that we learn a little about ideas on morality and justice when we read <a href="#/book/-JTVtEFxWghzkyJNe74g">Les Miserables</a>, we also absorb something of the places and locations where books are set.</p>

			<h3>Future Plans</h3>
			<p>Future plans are in the future :-)</p> 
			<ul>
				<li>Write this list better and more comprehensivly</li>
				<li>Notifications: get notified when there are updates/additions to the places and collections you're following.</li>
				<li>Connect your account to Goodreads. THis will allow you to save books form here to your bookreads (read, reading etc), and to bring books you've read to fictionset.in</li>
				<li>requests/nominations: You'll be able to nominate books you've heard about, but haven't read. Kind of like a 'suggested reading list' if you're out of ideas, and a way to prompt additions to the site.</li>	
				<li>Kindle pricing & links</li>
				<li>Location Images: I want to hook up images so that each place (eg. photos of Barcelona) has some atmosphere and life. This is a bit of a job though so will probably come later</li>
				<li>...and lots more.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural/backend</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Better (and more fun) achievements. Get (totally useless, but fun nonetheless) awards for doing things such as adding books, having your collections followed, adding suggestions.</li>
				<li>Tagging. So you can identify books in different ways (eg. historical). Ideally these will also be auto generated based on external information</li>
				<li>Site wide search</li>
				<li>Rebuild the login/authentication process to be simpler</li>
				<li>Fix up the site on mobile and tablet sizes</li>
				<li>...and lots more.</li>
			</ul>
